# Matrix and Vector Operations  Library

# DEPRECATED BRANCH

### Motivations

- to gain functional experience with implementing mathematical (linear algebraic) concepts in c++ code 
- demonstrate c++/c software development competencies
- reinforce basic building blocks of more advanced software applications of mathematical concepts

### Overview

- This library is a "C-*flavoured*" C++ library for extracting information about a linear system via matrices and linear
algebra. The code is a mix of C++ OOP paradigms and C features such as raw pointers and arrays. Though this mix isn't 
practical in most production environments, it is used here to show competency with both languages.
