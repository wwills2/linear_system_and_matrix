# Matrix and Vector Operations  Library
## Author: Zan Wills

### Motivations

- to gain functional experience with implementing mathematical (linear algebraic) concepts in c++ code 
- demonstrate c++/c software development competencies
- reinforce basic building blocks of advanced mathematical concepts used in software applications.

### Overview

- This library is a "C-*flavoured*" C++ library for extracting information about a linear system via matrices and linear
algebra. The code is a mix of C++ OOP paradigms and C features such as raw pointers and arrays. Though this mix isn't 
practical in most production environments, it is employed here as an 'academic' exercise. The underlying rational type
used for computation comes from the GNU Multiprecision Libaray.
